(This is a work in progress)

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease which is characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem and motor cortex.
Despite the important efforts to find new therapies to ALS, including targeting the immune system, no efficacious drug is available today. 
This highlights the need to better understand the processes implicated.
Although the cause of the disease is currently unknown, several hypotheses including oxidative stress, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate excitotoxicity and neuro-immune reactions are believed to participate in the motor neuron degenerative process (Boillee et al.2006a). 
While the majority of ALS cases are sporadic, 10% of them are inherited (familial), however sporadic and familial ALS produce similar pathological hallmarks, including an immune response in the affected tissues.

In this study, we develop a mathematical model of the interactions between astrocytes and neurons during ALS disease course.
Of course, neither this model nor any other mathematical or biological model can be conclusive, only unambiguous clinical trials can provide pragmatic information. However having a model, especially a SBML model which is independant of any toolset, permits to test ideas quickly.

Mathematical modeling can be a tool to give a coherent and quantitative framework for the discussion, to suggest possible physiological mechanisms and to help plan future experiments.
