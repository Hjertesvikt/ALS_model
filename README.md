# ALS_model
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of the adult,  characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem and motor cortex.
Despite the important efforts to find new therapies to ALS, including targeting the immune system, very limited options are available today. This highlights the need to better understand the processes implicated, especially in the progressive phase of the disease to slow down the course of motor neuron degeneration.
Although the cause of the disease is currently unknown, several hypotheses including oxidative stress, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate excitotoxicity and neuro-immune reactions are believed to participate in the motor neuron degenerative process (Boillee et al.2006a). 
The majority of ALS cases are sporadic, but 10% are inherited (familial), however sporadic and familial ALS produces similar pathological hallmarks, including an immune response in the affected tissues.

In this study, we develop a mathematical model of the interactions between astrocytes and neurons during ALS disease course.
Of course, neither the present model nor any other theoretical model can decide between the controversial views put forward by various authors, since only unambiguous experiments can close the debate. 
However, mathematical modeling can be a tool to give a coherent and quantitative framework for the discussion, to suggest possible physiological mechanisms and to help plan future experiments.
